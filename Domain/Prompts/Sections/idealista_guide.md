## Idealista Property Search

Search real estate listings across Spain, Italy, and Portugal via the Idealista API.

### Market Research Strategies

**Price Analysis**
- Search by location with different price ranges to understand market distribution
- Compare `priceByArea` (price per m²) across neighborhoods
- Sort by `pricedown` to find recent price reductions

**Location Comparison**
- Use `center` + `distance` for radius searches around specific coordinates
- Use `locationId` for administrative boundaries (provinces, cities)
- Compare similar property types across different areas

**Supply Analysis**
- Check `total` in results to gauge inventory levels
- Filter by `newDevelopment` to separate new construction from resale
- Use `preservation` filter ('good' vs 'renew') to analyze property conditions

**Trend Detection**
- Sort by `publicationDate` desc to see newest listings
- Sort by `modificationDate` to find recently updated prices
- Track `priceByArea` over multiple searches to spot trends

### Tips

- Start broad, then narrow with filters
- Use pagination (`numPage`) to get complete market picture
- Combine filters strategically: bedrooms + size + price narrows to specific segments
- Property URLs in results link directly to full listings
